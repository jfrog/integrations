# JFrog Platform

This Integration helps process extracted logs/metrics for the JFrog Platform, the universal, hybrid end-to-end DevOps platform. It should be a great help for any JFrog customer, but particularly for those managing multiple JFrog Platform high availability nodes. The app includes a complete diagnostic dashboard view for JFrog Artifactory with a few helpful views for Xray violation tracking. Please let JFrog know what else you would like to see, and feel free to visit our Github for more documentation at: github.com/jfrog/log-analytics.
